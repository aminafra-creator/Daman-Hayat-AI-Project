# AI Blood Biomarker Cancer Detection & UAE Health Statistics

## AI Blood Biomarker Cancer Detection Technologies

### Galleri Test (GRAIL)
**What it is:** Multi-cancer early detection (MCED) blood test using cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing

**Capabilities:**
- Detects **50+ cancer types** from a single blood draw
- Can identify cancer signal **before symptoms appear**
- Predicts tissue of origin with 88.7% accuracy
- Approved for adults 50+ years old
- Annual screening recommended

**How it works:**
- Analyzes DNA fragments shed by tumors into bloodstream
- Uses AI/ML to identify methylation patterns unique to cancer
- Distinguishes cancer signal from normal cell-free DNA

**Limitations:**
- Does NOT provide 10-year advance warning (typically 1-3 years before symptoms)
- Sensitivity varies by cancer type (higher for aggressive cancers)
- Not a replacement for standard screening (mammogram, colonoscopy)

### Cancer Types Detectable via AI Blood Biomarkers

**High-sensitivity cancers (easier to detect early):**
- Pancreatic cancer
- Liver cancer
- Esophageal cancer
- Stomach cancer
- Ovarian cancer
- Lung cancer
- Colorectal cancer (advanced stages)

**Moderate-sensitivity cancers:**
- Breast cancer

- Kidney cancer
- Bladder cancer

**Genome-specific risk factors:**
- **BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations** → Breast, ovarian cancer risk
- **Lynch syndrome** → Colorectal, uterine, stomach cancer risk

- **PALB2 mutations** → Breast, pancreatic cancer risk
- **APC gene** → Colorectal cancer (familial adenomatous polyposis)

**AI + Genome Integration:**
- Combines genetic predisposition (genome) with current biomarker signals (blood)
- Identifies individuals at high risk 10+ years before cancer develops
- Enables targeted lifestyle interventions and enhanced surveillance
