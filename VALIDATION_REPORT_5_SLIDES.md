- **Emotion:** Confidence, interest

### **Slide 3 (Roadmap):**
- **Before:** "How will they execute?"
- **After:** "Clear 18-month path to Series A with $500K ARR, 75% retention, Thiqa LOI—this is fundable"
- **Emotion:** Conviction, excitement

### **Slide 4 (Visual Proof):**
- **Before:** "Is the crisis real or just marketing?"
- **After:** "The graph doesn't lie—UAE worsened 45% while top countries improved 23%. This is a real crisis."
- **Emotion:** Urgency (reinforced), concern

### **Slide 5 (Validation):**
