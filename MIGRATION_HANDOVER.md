## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

### **From Critical Analysis Report (Grade: D+ / 61.75/100):**

**FATAL FLAWS (Must Fix):**
1. ❌ **No Team Slide** - Investors don't know who you are
2. ❌ **No Traction/Proof** - Zero evidence platform exists
3. ❌ **Unclear Thiqa Partnership** - Is Daman/Hayat committed?

**HIGH PRIORITY:**
4. ⚠️ **No Competitive Analysis** - Who else is doing this?
5. ⚠️ **Vague Go-to-Market** - How will you acquire 75,000 members?
6. ⚠️ **Missing Risk Section** - What could go wrong?

**MEDIUM PRIORITY:**
7. ⚠️ **No Product Screenshots** - Show the platform
8. ⚠️ **Weak Regulatory Strategy** - UAE health data regulations?
9. ⚠️ **No Exit Strategy** - How do investors get returns?

   - Regulatory approval (DHA, HAAD)

### **Phase 3: Polish & Practice (Week 5-6)**
7. **Add Product Screenshots**
