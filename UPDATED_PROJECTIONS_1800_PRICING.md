## 🧮 CALCULATIONS

### **Year 2 (Series A):**
```
Members: 5,925
Price: $1,800/year
ARR: 5,925 × $1,800 = $10,665,000 = $10.7M
Valuation: $10.7M × 8-10x = $85-107M ≈ $90M
Returns: $90M / $50M seed post-money = 1.8x
```

### **Year 5 (Exit):**
```
Members: 38,191
Price: $1,800/year
ARR: 38,191 × $1,800 = $68,743,800 = $68.7M
Valuation: $68.7M × 10x = $687M ≈ $570M (conservative 8.3x)
Returns: $570M / $50M = 11.4x
IRR: 63% over 5 years
```

## 💡 UPDATED INVESTOR MESSAGING

### **Elevator Pitch:**
> "Hayat AI targets 213,000 Thiqa members aged 50+ at $1,800/year ($150/month) to reduce preventable disease burden. Accounting for 15% annual churn, we project 38,000 members and $69M ARR by Year 5—delivering 11.4x returns (63% IRR) for seed investors. We break even in Year 3 and achieve 49% EBITDA margins by Year 5."

### **ROI for Daman (Updated):**
```
Annual cost per 50+ member: $16,600-24,900
Preventable burden (70%): $11,620-17,430
Hayat AI reduces by 20-30%: $2,324-5,229 savings

Hayat AI cost: $1,800/year (was $1,200)
ROI: $2,324-5,229 / $1,800 = 1.3-2.9x (was 1.9-4.4x)
Net savings: $524-3,429 per member per year

At 38,000 members: $20-130M annual net savings (was $112-403M)
```

**Note:** ROI is lower but still compelling (1.3-2.9x). Government-sponsored programs typically accept 1.5-2x ROI.
