**Purple Border:** YES - Add 3px solid purple (#a855f7) border around entire slide

---

### Update 2: Add CVD #1 Killer Messaging

**Target Slide:** Slide 2 - "UAE Nationals Live 16 Years in Poor Health"

**Add New Section After Existing Content:**

```
The #1 Killer: Cardiovascular Disease

40% of all UAE deaths are from CVD
2x UAE CVD death rate vs. global average

Heart disease is striking younger ‚Äî average age of heart attack decreasing.
We must detect and prevent early, not treat late.
```

**Styling:**
- Background: Red gradient box (matching crisis theme)
- Layout: 2-column stat display
  - Left: "40%" large number, "of all UAE deaths are from CVD" subtitle
  - Right: "2x" large number, "UAE CVD death rate vs. global average" subtitle
- Bottom text: "Heart disease is striking younger..." (bold "striking younger")
- Border: Red accent to match crisis messaging

**Purple Border:** YES - Add 3px solid purple (#a855f7) border around entire slide

---

### Update 3: Enhance Slide 6 (Solution Overview)

**Target Slide:** Slide 6 - "The Solution: Detection + Monitoring + Prevention"

**Current Text:** "AI-powered screening using **five data sources** detects disease 5-10 years before symptoms."

**Update To:** "AI-powered screening using **six data sources** detects disease 5-10 years before symptoms."

**Note:** This slide shows 5 detection methods (Blood, Genome, Imaging, Retinal, Wearables). The detailed breakdown is on Slide 8 which will show 7 sources after adding Cancer Detection.

**Purple Border:** Optional (only if you want to mark it as updated)

---

### Update 4: Optional New Slide - AI Cancer Detection Deep Dive

**Insert After:** Slide 8 (Multi-Modal Detection)  
**New Slide Number:** 9

**Title:** AI Cancer Detection: 10-Year Advance Warning

**Layout:** Two-column

**Left Column: How It Works**
- Combines blood biomarkers (circulating tumor DNA) with genome analysis
- AI identifies methylation patterns unique to cancer
- Predicts cancer development 10 years before symptoms appear
- Enables lifestyle interventions before cancer forms

**Right Column: What We Detect**
- **Most Common UAE Cancers:**
  - üéóÔ∏è Breast cancer (#1 in women, #1 cause of cancer death)
  - üî¨ Colorectal cancer (#3 overall, #2 cause of cancer death)
  - ü¶ã Thyroid cancer (#2 overall)
  - ü´Å Lung cancer (#1 in men)

**Bottom Section: Genome-Specific Risks**
- BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations ‚Üí Breast, ovarian cancer
- Lynch syndrome ‚Üí Colorectal, uterine cancer
- TP53 mutations ‚Üí Multiple cancer types
- PALB2 mutations ‚Üí Breast, pancreatic cancer

**Statistics:**
- 50+ cancer types detectable
- 10-year advance warning (with genome integration)
- 88.7% accuracy for tissue of origin
- 15.4% of colorectal cancers occur in patients under 40 in UAE

**Purple Border:** YES - This is a new slide

## üü£ Purple Border Implementation

**Method:** Add 3px solid purple border to updated slides

**Slides to Mark:**
- ‚úÖ Slide 2 (CVD #1 killer added)
- ‚úÖ Slide 8 (7th data source added)
- ‚úÖ Slide 9 (new cancer detection slide - optional)

**How to Add in PowerPoint:**
1. Select the slide in slide sorter view
2. Right-click ‚Üí Format Background
3. Add border/frame with color #a855f7 (purple)
4. Set width to 3px
5. Apply to slide

**Alternative Method:**

## üéØ Key Messaging Updates

### Cancer Detection Messaging
**Problem:** "Cancer is the 2nd leading cause of death in UAE (12% of deaths). Breast, colorectal, and lung cancers are most common, with alarming rise in young-onset cases."

**Solution:** "Hayat AI combines blood biomarker analysis with genome sequencing to detect 50+ cancer types up to 10 years before symptoms appear. This gives high-risk individuals time to make lifestyle changes that prevent cancer from developing."

**Example:** "If your genome shows BRCA1 mutation (breast cancer risk) and blood biomarkers show early cellular changes, we alert you 10 years before cancer forms‚Äîgiving you time to modify diet, exercise, and stress to prevent it."

### CVD #1 Killer Messaging
**Problem:** "Cardiovascular disease kills more Emiratis than any other disease‚Äî40% of all deaths. UAE CVD death rates are twice the global average, and heart disease is striking younger every year."

**Solution:** "Hayat AI's 6-source detection (retinal, DEXA, wearables, blood, genome, imaging) catches cardiovascular disease 5-10 years before the first symptom‚Äîwhich is often a heart attack or sudden death."

**Urgency:** "We can't wait for symptoms. By the time you feel chest pain, your arteries are 70%+ blocked. We catch it at 20-30% when lifestyle changes can reverse the disease."
