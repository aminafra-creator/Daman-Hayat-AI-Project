## 💬 SPEAKER NOTES / TALKING POINTS

### **Opening Hook (10 seconds):**
"Before we go further, you might be asking: 'Is Digital Twin technology real, or is this just hype?' Let me show you the proof—from both academia and venture capital."

### **Academic Validation (30 seconds):**
"Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine is running the DigiTwin Project with 12 million patient records—one of the largest Digital Twin healthcare research initiatives in the world. They've published groundbreaking research in Nature and The Lancet, with 373 citations proving Digital Twins work for diabetes, sepsis, multiple sclerosis, cancer, and pediatric care. This isn't theoretical—it's peer-reviewed science from one of America's top medical schools."

### **Twin Health - Investor Validation (40 seconds):**
"Now let's talk about investor validation. Twin Health, a Silicon Valley startup using Digital Twin AI for metabolic health, has raised $296 million and is currently valued at $950 million—just $50 million away from unicorn status. Their latest round was led by Maj Invest from Denmark, with backing from Iconiq Capital and Singapore's Temasek sovereign wealth fund. Why are they worth nearly a billion dollars? Because in Cleveland Clinic trials, 71% of their users reversed diabetes using their Digital Twin platform. That's not a pilot study—that's proven clinical efficacy at scale."

### **PrediSurge - Cardiovascular Validation (25 seconds):**
"It's not just metabolic health. PrediSurge, a French company, raised €6.5 million in Series A funding for cardiovascular Digital Twins. They create 3D patient-specific models that surgeons use to plan heart procedures, reducing risk and improving outcomes. This proves Digital Twin technology works across multiple disease areas—metabolic, cardiovascular, and beyond."

### **Market Growth (20 seconds):**
"The Digital Twin healthcare market is exploding. It's projected to grow from $1.2 billion in 2024 to $6.1 billion by 2030—that's 28.9% annual growth. Over $300 million has been invested in Digital Twin health startups in just the past three years. Investors see what we see: this is the future of personalized medicine."

### **Hayat AI Positioning (30 seconds):**
"Here's our opportunity. Twin Health focused on metabolic health and is worth $950 million. We're building a comprehensive Digital Twin for CVD, diabetes, AND cancer—a much larger addressable market. Twin Health targets the US and global markets. We're targeting the UAE and GCC, where the disease burden is 1.8 times higher and the market is underserved. If a metabolic-only Digital Twin is worth nearly a billion dollars, a comprehensive Digital Twin for the UAE's $11 billion health crisis is worth significantly more. We're not inventing the technology—we're applying proven tech to an urgent, underserved market."

### **Transition to Next Slide (10 seconds):**
"So we have the market opportunity, the proven technology, and investor validation. Now let me show you exactly how we'll execute: our 18-month roadmap from seed funding to Series A."
