  The Healthspan Crisis: Living Longer, But Sicker
  UAE Healthspan vs Lifespan Trend (2000-2025)
  Source: WHO Global Health Observatory, Worldometers (2025), PMC (2023)
  The Crisis
  Medical advances keep us alive longer, but don't keep us healthy longer. The gap has widened from 11 to 16 years‚Äîthat's 16 years lived with chronic disease, disability, and diminished quality of life.
  The Economic Opportunity
  Adding 1 year of healthspan = 4-5% of GDP annually

  A Global Crisis: UAE Ranks #7 Worst
  Years Lived in Poor Health - International Comparison
  UAE ranks #7 globally with 15.9 years lived in poor health (Health-Adjusted Life Expectancy 67.3 years, Life Expectancy 83.2 years). This isn't just a local challenge‚Äîit's a global crisis where UAE is among the worst performers. The opportunity to improve healthspan is massive, and the urgency is clear.

  Precision Medicine Trained on Emirati Population
  Why UAE-Specific AI Matters
  Western Models
  Generic algorithms trained on European and American populations. Completely misses Middle Eastern genetic variations and metabolic patterns.
  Our Emirati-Specific Model
  AI trained on Emirati-specific data. Accounts for regional genetic markers in diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic disorders unique to the population.
  Cultural Adaptation
  Emirati cuisine-based nutrition plans, Ramadan-aware health protocols, and family-centered wellness programs that respect local traditions.
  Population Scale Precision
  Delivering precision medicine for 1 million+ Thiqa members simultaneously, not just individual patients in clinical trials.
  Competitors use generic Western models that don't account for Emirati genetics or culture. We deliver precision medicine at population scale powered by UAE-specific data.
