# Financial Audit Report: Daman-Hayat AI Presentation
## Currency Inconsistencies & ROI Calculation Errors

**Date:** November 6, 2025  
**Auditor:** Manus AI  
**Purpose:** Identify and correct all currency mix (AED/USD) and unsystematic ROI calculations

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

### **Issue #1: Currency Mix (AED and USD)**
**Severity:** ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ CRITICAL

The presentation mixes AED and USD throughout, creating confusion and inconsistency.

### **Issue #2: ROI Calculations Not Shown**
**Severity:** ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ HIGH

ROI percentages are stated without showing the calculation formulas or methodology.

### **Issue #3: Unverified Numbers**
**Severity:** ⚠️⚠️⚠️ MEDIUM

Some statistics lack clear sources or verification.

## 📊 **DETAILED FINDINGS BY SLIDE**

### **SLIDE 10: Total Annual Cost**
**Current:**
- "AED 40 Billion Lost Every Year"
- "$11B Total Annual Cost"
- "$5.2B" (one disease)
- "$5.7B" (another disease)
- "$3.0B" (Thiqa budget)

**Issues:**
1. ❌ Title says "AED 40 Billion" but body shows "$11B" (which currency?)
2. ❌ AED 40B ≠ $11B (AED 40B = $10.9B at 3.67 rate)
3. ❌ $5.2B + $5.7B = $10.9B, not $11B
4. ❌ No breakdown showing which disease costs what

**Corrections Needed:**
- ✅ Convert ALL to USD
- ✅ Show calculation: $5.2B + $5.7B = $10.9B ≈ $11B
- ✅ Clarify disease breakdown (CVD, Diabetes, Cancer)
- ✅ Verify Thiqa budget ($3.0B = AED 11B)

---

### **SLIDE 11: Cost Advantage**
**Current:**
- "$55-140" (one test)
- "$270-1,400" (CT/MRI)
- "$30" (retinal screening)
- "$100-200" (DEXA)

**Issues:**
1. ❌ No source for these costs
2. ❌ "90-95% cost reduction" not calculated/shown
3. ❌ Unclear which test costs what

**Corrections Needed:**
- ✅ Add sources for all cost figures
- ✅ Show calculation: $30 vs. $270 = 89% reduction (not 90-95%)
- ✅ Label each test clearly

---

### **SLIDE 12: Investment & ROI**
**Current:**
- "Investment: $15M"
- "5-Year Return: AED 284M"
- "ROI: 1,893%"

**Issues:**
1. ❌ **CURRENCY MIX:** Investment in USD, return in AED
2. ❌ **ROI CALCULATION NOT SHOWN:** How is 1,893% calculated?
3. ❌ **Inconsistent:** Should be both USD or both AED

**Correct Calculation:**
```
Investment: $15M = AED 55M (at 3.67 rate)
Return: AED 284M
Net Profit: AED 284M - AED 55M = AED 229M
ROI = (Net Profit / Investment) × 100
ROI = (AED 229M / AED 55M) × 100 = 416% ❌ NOT 1,893%

OR if using different methodology:
ROI = (Return / Investment) × 100 - 100
ROI = (AED 284M / AED 55M) × 100 - 100 = 516% - 100 = 416%

The 1,893% appears to be:
(AED 284M / $15M) × 100 = 1,893%
This is WRONG because it mixes currencies!
```

**Corrections Needed:**
- ✅ Convert ALL to USD: Investment $15M, Return $77M, Net Profit $62M
- ✅ Show formula: ROI = ($62M / $15M) × 100 = 413%
- ✅ OR keep in AED: Investment AED 55M, Return AED 284M, ROI = 416%

---

### **SLIDE 14: Thiqa Market**
**Current:**
- "1 Million+ Thiqa Members, $3.0B Market"
- "$3.0B" (100%)

**Issues:**
1. ❌ $3.0B = AED 11B (Thiqa budget) - this is correct
2. ✅ No issues if consistently USD

**Corrections Needed:**
- ✅ Verify $3.0B is correct (AED 11B ÷ 3.67 = $3.0B) ✓

---

### **SLIDE 18: ROI Claims**
**Current:**
- "15% Reduction in Diabetes"
- "20% Reduction Late-Stage Cancer"
- "$7 Saved per $1 Invested"

**Issues:**
1. ❌ No source for "$7 saved per $1 invested"
2. ❌ No calculation showing how this relates to overall ROI
3. ❌ Unclear timeframe (5 years? 10 years?)

**Corrections Needed:**
- ✅ Add source (e.g., "Based on Singapore PPP model")
- ✅ Show calculation linking to $15M investment
- ✅ Clarify timeframe

---

### **SLIDE 19: Scenario Analysis**
**Current:**
- **Optimal (1.5%):** Investment $15M, Return AED 284M, ROI 1,893%
- **Moderate (1.0%):** Investment $15M, Return AED 180M, ROI 927%
- **Conservative (0.5%):** Investment $15M, Return AED 90M, ROI 360%

**Issues:**
1. ❌ **CURRENCY MIX:** Investment in USD, returns in AED
2. ❌ **ROI CALCULATIONS WRONG:** Using mixed currencies
3. ❌ **No formulas shown**

**Correct Calculations:**

#### **Optimal Scenario (1.5% penetration):**
```
Investment: $15M = AED 55M
Return: AED 284M = $77M
Net Profit: $77M - $15M = $62M
ROI = ($62M / $15M) × 100 = 413%  ❌ NOT 1,893%
```

#### **Moderate Scenario (1.0% penetration):**
```
Investment: $15M = AED 55M
Return: AED 180M = $49M
Net Profit: $49M - $15M = $34M
ROI = ($34M / $15M) × 100 = 227%  ❌ NOT 927%
```

#### **Conservative Scenario (0.5% penetration):**
```
Investment: $15M = AED 55M
Return: AED 90M = $25M
Net Profit: $25M - $15M = $10M
ROI = ($10M / $15M) × 100 = 67%  ❌ NOT 360%
```

**Corrections Needed:**
- ✅ Convert ALL to USD for consistency
- ✅ Show ROI formula on slide
- ✅ Recalculate all ROI percentages correctly

---

### **SLIDE 20: Unit Economics**
**Current:**
- "LTV: AED 18,900"
- "CAC: AED 500"
- "LTV/CAC Ratio: 37.8x"
- "Payback Period: 3.3 months"
- "Monthly Revenue per Member: AED 150"

**Issues:**
1. ❌ All in AED, should be USD for consistency
2. ✅ LTV/CAC calculation appears correct: 18,900 ÷ 500 = 37.8x
3. ❌ Payback calculation not shown
4. ❌ LTV calculation not shown

**Correct Calculations:**
```
Monthly Revenue: AED 150 = $41/month
CAC: AED 500 = $136
Payback Period = CAC / Monthly Revenue
Payback = $136 / $41 = 3.3 months ✓ CORRECT

LTV (5 years): $41/month × 60 months = $2,460
LTV: AED 18,900 = $5,150 (assumes longer lifetime or churn adjustment)

LTV/CAC = $5,150 / $136 = 37.9x ✓ CORRECT
```

**Corrections Needed:**
- ✅ Convert all to USD
- ✅ Show LTV calculation formula
- ✅ Show payback calculation formula
- ✅ Clarify LTV timeframe (5 years? Lifetime?)

---

### **SLIDE 22: Investment Allocation**
**Current:**
- "Total Investment: $15M ($15M)"
- "30%: AED 16.5M"
- "25%: AED 13.75M"
- "20%: AED 11M"
- "15%: AED 8.25M"
- "10%: AED 5.5M"

**Issues:**
1. ❌ **CURRENCY MIX:** Title in USD, breakdown in AED
2. ❌ **CALCULATION ERROR:** Percentages don't match AED amounts

**Correct Calculations:**
```
Total Investment: $15M = AED 55M

30% = AED 55M × 0.30 = AED 16.5M ✓ CORRECT
25% = AED 55M × 0.25 = AED 13.75M ✓ CORRECT
20% = AED 55M × 0.20 = AED 11M ✓ CORRECT
15% = AED 55M × 0.15 = AED 8.25M ✓ CORRECT
10% = AED 55M × 0.10 = AED 5.5M ✓ CORRECT

Total = 16.5 + 13.75 + 11 + 8.25 + 5.5 = AED 55M ✓ CORRECT
```

**Corrections Needed:**
- ✅ Convert ALL to USD for consistency
- ✅ Show: 30% of $15M = $4.5M, etc.

## 🧮 **CORRECTED ROI CALCULATIONS**

### **Methodology:**
```
ROI = (Net Profit / Investment) × 100

Where:
- Investment = Initial capital required
- Net Profit = Total Return - Investment
- Return = Revenue generated over period
```

### **Optimal Scenario (1.5% penetration):**
```
Investment: $15M
5-Year Revenue: $77M (AED 284M ÷ 3.67)
Net Profit: $77M - $15M = $62M
ROI = ($62M / $15M) × 100 = 413%

Formula shown on slide:
ROI = (Return - Investment) / Investment × 100
ROI = ($77M - $15M) / $15M × 100 = 413%
```

### **Moderate Scenario (1.0% penetration):**
```
Investment: $15M
5-Year Revenue: $49M (AED 180M ÷ 3.67)
Net Profit: $49M - $15M = $34M
ROI = ($34M / $15M) × 100 = 227%
```

### **Conservative Scenario (0.5% penetration):**
```
Investment: $15M
5-Year Revenue: $25M (AED 90M ÷ 3.67)
Net Profit: $25M - $15M = $10M
ROI = ($10M / $15M) × 100 = 67%
```
