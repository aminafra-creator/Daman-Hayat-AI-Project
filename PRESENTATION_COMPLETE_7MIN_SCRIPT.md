## PART 1: THE OPENING (0:00 - 2:00)

### **The Human Advantage (0:00 - 0:30)**

"Good morning. We are here today not to talk about healthcare costs, but to talk about a future for Abu Dhabi. A future where every citizen has the chance to live not just a longer life, but a healthier, more vibrant one.

Imagine adding 10, 15, even 20 more healthy years to the lives of your parents, your grandparents, and your children. Years filled with productivity, with family, with joy. This isn't a distant dream; it is the direct outcome of a strategic partnership we are proposing today. This is about fulfilling the promise of UAE Vision 2030—to create the healthiest and happiest nation on Earth, starting right here in Abu Dhabi."

---

### **The Strategic Advantage (0:30 - 1:15)**

"For Daman, this represents a fundamental shift. Imagine transforming from a world-class insurance provider into a world-leading healthspan partner. A Daman that doesn't just react to illness, but proactively prevents it.

A partnership with us will empower Daman to move beyond managing claims and instead manage health, unlocking unprecedented efficiency and ensuring its own long-term financial sustainability. It will position Daman as a global pioneer, an innovator that uses cutting-edge AI not just to pay for treatment, but to make treatment unnecessary. This is your opportunity to lead the entire insurance industry into the future."

---

### **The Economic Advantage (1:15 - 2:00)**

"And the benefits extend far beyond healthcare. A healthier population is a more productive population. It means a stronger workforce, more innovation, and a more resilient economy for decades to come.

But more than that, this partnership will ignite a new high-tech ecosystem right here in Abu Dhabi. We are talking about creating a global hub for AI-driven health, attracting world-class talent in genomics, data science, and personalized medicine. This isn't just about investing in a healthcare solution; it is about investing in Abu Dhabi's economic destiny. It is about creating a new pillar of the knowledge economy that will pay dividends for generations.

Today, we will show you exactly how we achieve this future, together."

## PART 2: THE SOLUTION & VALUE (2:00 - 7:00)

### **The "How": Explaining the Digital Twin (2:00 - 3:00)**

"So, how do we make this future a reality? The answer lies in a proven, breakthrough technology called a Digital Twin.

Think of it as a virtual, living replica of your own body. It's an AI-powered model that gets smarter every day, integrating data from six crucial sources: your genetics, your lab results, your wearable data, your medical imaging, your lifestyle, and even your family history. 

This isn't just data collection; it's deep, predictive intelligence. Our platform analyzes this information to see what the human eye can't—predicting the risk of chronic diseases like diabetes or heart disease 3 to 5 years *before* they happen. This gives us a critical window to intervene. To prevent, not just treat.

And this isn't experimental. The core technology is validated by over 20 years of research at institutions like Mount Sinai. And the business model is proven by companies like Twin Health, a metabolic digital twin platform recently valued at nearly a billion dollars. We are taking this proven technology and optimizing it for the unique genetics, culture, and healthcare system of the UAE."

### **The Value to Daman (3:00 - 4:15)**

"For Daman, the impact is immediate and profound. Let's start with the numbers.

By focusing on the highest-risk 27% of Thiqa members, we directly address the 60-70% of costs associated with preventable chronic disease. Our conservative projections show that for every dollar Daman invests in a member on our platform, it saves between two and three dollars in healthcare costs. 

At scale, this translates to over **one hundred million dollars in net savings annually**. Over ten years, the cumulative value to Daman is between **500 million and 1.5 billion dollars**.

This isn't just about cost savings. This is about transforming Daman's business model for the future. It ensures long-term sustainability and solidifies your position as a global leader in proactive, AI-driven healthcare. It makes you a partner in your members' health, not just a payer for their sickness."

---

### **The Value to Abu Dhabi's People (4:15 - 5:15)**

"But the most important return isn't measured in dollars. It's measured in years. Healthy years.

For the citizens of Abu Dhabi, this platform will add, conservatively, **150,000 healthy years of life** over the next decade. These are years a father gets to spend with his children. Years a grandmother remains active and independent. Years a skilled professional continues to contribute their expertise.

We will prevent thousands of cases of diabetes, heart attacks, and cancer. We will transform the lives of over 38,000 people in the first five years alone, and in doing so, protect the well-being of over 400,000 of their family members. This is the human return on investment—and it is the reason we are all in this room today."

---

### **The Value to Abu Dhabi's Economy (5:15 - 6:15)**

"This human return fuels the economic engine of Abu Dhabi. A healthier population is a more productive workforce. The value of this increased productivity, combined with the direct healthcare savings, creates a **3 to 6 billion dollar positive impact** on Abu Dhabi's economy over the next decade. It directly supports the goals of Vision 2030 by creating a resilient, knowledge-based economy.

But this isn't just about the numbers on a spreadsheet. This partnership positions Abu Dhabi as a global innovation hub. It attracts the world's best minds in AI, genomics, and personalized medicine. It creates intellectual property, export opportunities, and a new pillar of economic growth that will serve the nation for generations to come."

---

### **The Big Reveal (6:15 - 7:00)**

"So, what is a solution like this actually worth?

*(Pause for 2-3 seconds)*

When you combine the direct savings to Daman, the economic impact for Abu Dhabi, and the quality of life value for your citizens, the total value created by this partnership is between **12.5 and 26 billion dollars**.

*(Pause for 3-5 seconds. Let the number sink in.)*

Let that number sink in. This is the true scale of the opportunity before us."

### **The Critical Pause (6:45-7:00):**

After you say "**12.5 to 26 billion dollars**," you MUST pause for 5 full seconds. This will feel like an eternity, but it's essential. The audience needs time to process the magnitude of the number. They will be thinking:

- "That's enormous."
- "This must cost a fortune."
- "How much are they asking for?"

This is the perfect psychological setup for Slide 7, where you reveal the tiny $15-20M ask. The contrast will be stunning, and the ask will feel like a no-brainer.

**Slide 7 (7:00-8:30):** The Ask - "$15-20M (0.08% of value created)"

This is where you transition to the ask, execution plan, and close. That section will be drafted separately.
