The Healthspan Crisis: Living Longer, But Sicker
UAE Healthspan vs Lifespan Trend (2000-2025)
Source: WHO Global Health Observatory, Worldometers (2025), PMC (2023)
The Crisis
Medical advances keep us alive longer, but don't keep us healthy longer. Since 2000 the gap has widened 45% from 11 to 16 years—that's 16 years lived with chronic disease, disability, and diminished quality of life.
The Economic Opportunity
Adding 1 year of healthspan = 4-5% of GDP annually

A Crisis: UAE Ranks #7 Worst
Years Lived in Poor Health - International Comparison
UAE ranks #7 globally with 15.9 years lived in poor health (Health-Adjusted Life Expectancy 67.3 years, Life Expectancy 83.2 years). This isn't just a local challenge—it's a crisis where UAE is among the worst performers. The opportunity to improve healthspan is massive, and the urgency is clear.

Precision Medicine Trained on Emirati Population
Why UAE-Specific AI Matters
Western Models
Generic algorithms trained on European and American populations. Completely misses Middle Eastern genetic variations and metabolic patterns.
Our Emirati-Specific Model
AI trained on Emirati-specific data. Accounts for regional genetic markers in diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic disorders unique to the population.
Cultural Adaptation
Emirati cuisine-based nutrition plans, Ramadan-aware health protocols, and family-centered wellness programs that respect local traditions.
Population Scale Precision
Delivering precision medicine for 1 million+ Thiqa members simultaneously, not just individual patients in clinical trials.
Competitors use generic Western models that don't account for Emirati genetics or culture. We deliver precision medicine at population scale powered by UAE-specific data.
