I'm continuing the Daman-Hayat AI project from a previous chat. All work has been migrated to GitHub.

GitHub Repository: https://github.com/aminafra-creator/Daman-Hayat-AI-Project

Please start by:
1. Accessing the GitHub repository (you're already authenticated as aminafra-creator)
2. Reading migration/MIGRATION_HANDOVER.md for complete context
3. Reviewing migration/CRITICAL_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md to understand weaknesses

Project Summary:
- Hayat AI: Digital Twin healthspan platform for UAE (Daman/Hayat Insurance)
- Target: $15M fundraise for 500,000+ members
- Status: Presentation 80% complete, needs fatal flaws fixed

What's Been Completed:
✅ Research documents (USD converted, verified statistics)
✅ Presentation (24 slides: Triple Threat, Digital Twin, Health Score)
✅ Health Score V2.0 framework (6 pillars, Blueprint-optimized)
✅ Critical analysis (identified 3 fatal flaws, 7 weaknesses)
✅ Financial audit (ROI corrected to 413%)

Critical Issues to Fix (Phase 1 - URGENT):
❌ No Team Slide - investors don't know who we are
❌ No Traction/Proof - zero evidence platform exists  
❌ Unclear Thiqa Partnership - is Daman/Hayat committed?

Standards to Maintain:
- Everything backed by files (no hallucinations)
- USD currency only (rounded, no AED mix)
- Show all calculations (transparent methodology)
- Display token usage after each response (bar chart format)
- Auto-commit all changes to GitHub

Let's continue by addressing the fatal flaws. Ready to start with creating the Team Slide?
