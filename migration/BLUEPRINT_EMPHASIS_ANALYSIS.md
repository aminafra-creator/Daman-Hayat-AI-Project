# Bryan Johnson Blueprint: Emphasis Analysis for Hayat Health Score

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive research of Bryan Johnson's Blueprint protocol, this document analyzes where he places the most emphasis for healthspan optimization across three dimensions: **time investment**, **financial investment**, and **measurement priorities**.

---

## 1. TIME INVESTMENT ANALYSIS

### **Daily Time Allocation (24 hours)**

| Category | Daily Time | % of Day | Rank |
|----------|-----------|----------|------|
| **Sleep + Preparation** | 10 hours | 41.7% | **#1** |
| Work | 9 hours | 37.5% | #4 |
| **Exercise + Movement** | 2.5 hours | 10.4% | **#2** |
| **Diet (prep + eating)** | 2 hours | 8.3% | **#3** |
| Skin/Hair Care | 30 min | 2.1% | #5 |
| Supplements | 30 min | 2.1% | #6 |
| Oral Care | 20 min | 1.4% | #7 |

**Total Protocol Time:** 15 hours/day (62.5%)

### **Key Findings:**

1. **Sleep is #1 priority** - 41.7% of day (more than work at 37.5%)
2. **Exercise is #2 priority** - 10.4% of day (1.5 hours structured + movement breaks)
3. **Diet is #3 priority** - 8.3% of day (time-restricted eating, 5.5-hour window)
4. **Protocol is non-negotiable** - Work fits around protocol, not vice versa

## 2. EXPLICIT PRIORITY STATEMENTS

### **Three Power Laws of Health (April 4, 2025)**

Bryan Johnson explicitly ranks his priorities:

**Power Law #1: SLEEP**
> "Consistent, high quality sleep is your #1 life priority"
> "You are a professional sleeper"
> "It's the foundation of every other part of your life"
> "If you get your sleep right, everything else becomes easier"

**Power Law #2: EXERCISE**
> "When you sleep well, you feel well. When you feel well, you move well."

**Power Law #3: DIET**
> "That's why diet is Power Law #3, not #1"
> "When you're well-rested and moving, you naturally want to eat better"
> "If you're sleep-deprived and sedentary, your cravings take over"

### **Cascading Priority System:**
1. Sleep enables exercise
2. Sleep + Exercise enable better diet choices
3. Without sleep, willpower fails

This is **NOT** equal weighting—it's a hierarchical dependency system.

## 3. BIOMARKER MEASUREMENT PRIORITIES

### **11 Biomarkers Tracked (Dr. Mike Mallin, Don't Die Summit)**

| Category | Biomarkers | % of Total | Emphasis |
|----------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Cardiovascular** | 4 (LDL-C, LDL-P, HDL-C, hsCRP, Omega-3) | 36.4% | **#1** |
| **Metabolic** | 3 (HbA1c, Insulin, AST/ALT) | 27.3% | **#2** |
| **Hormonal** | 2 (Testosterone, Estradiol/Progesterone) | 18.2% | #3 |
| **Kidney** | 1 (Cystatin-C) | 9.1% | #4 |
| **Immune/Vitamin** | 1 (Vitamin D) | 9.1% | #5 |

**Note:** hsCRP (inflammation) is marked as **"MOST IMPORTANT"** biomarker

### **9 "Top 1%" Biomarkers (Blueprint Website)**

1. Speed of aging
2. Muscle mass function
3. Fat mass
4. Inflammation
5. Cardiovascular
6. Bone mass
7. Sleep
8. Combined clinical markers
9. Nighttime erections

| **TOTAL** | $2,000,000 | 100% | $166,667 | $5,479 |

**Note:** These are estimates based on reported $2M annual spending and protocol details.

### **Key Findings:**

1. **Medical testing & monitoring = 50%** of budget (most expensive category)
2. **Diet & supplements = 17.5%** (second largest category)
3. **Advanced therapies = 15%** (HBOT, Cerebrolysin, gene therapy experiments)
4. **Sleep = 5%** (despite being #1 time priority, relatively low cost)

## 5. PROTOCOL EMPHASIS BY HEALTH DOMAIN

### **Comprehensive Analysis Across All Dimensions**

| Health Domain | Time | Biomarkers | Cost | **Weighted Avg** |
|--------------|------|-----------|------|-----------------|
| **Sleep & Recovery** | 41.7% | 11.1% (1/9) | 5% | **19.3%** |
| **Cardiovascular** | 10.4% | 36.4% | 7.5% | **18.1%** |
| **Metabolic** | 8.3% | 27.3% | 17.5% | **17.7%** |
| **Exercise/Physical** | 10.4% | 11.1% (1/9) | 7.5% | **9.7%** |
| **Hormonal** | 0% | 18.2% | 0% | **6.1%** |
| **Cognitive/Mental** | 0% | 0% | 0% | **0%** |
| **Microbiome** | 0% | 0% | 0% | **0%** |

**Calculation Method:**
- Time weight: 40%
- Biomarker weight: 40%
- Cost weight: 20%

### **Adjusted for Missing Categories:**

Bryan's protocol **does not explicitly track** cognitive health or microbiome health as separate categories (yet). However, he mentions:

- **Gut microbiome test** - Coming soon on Blueprint website
- **Mental health** - Not explicitly tracked, but implied through sleep quality, HRV, stress management
- **Cognitive health** - Not explicitly tracked as separate biomarker category

## Conclusion

Bryan Johnson's Blueprint protocol provides clear evidence for prioritizing **sleep (25%)**, **cardiovascular health (25%)**, and **metabolic health (20%)** as the foundation of healthspan optimization. These three pillars account for **70% of the health score** and align with both his time investment (60.4% of protocol time) and biomarker tracking (63.7% of measured biomarkers).

The revised Hayat Health Score weighting system reflects this evidence-based approach while maintaining coverage of cognitive, mental, and microbiome health as emerging priorities.

**Final Recommendation:** Adopt the Blueprint-optimized weighting system for Hayat AI.
