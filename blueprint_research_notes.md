## THREE POWER LAWS OF HEALTH (April 4, 2025 Article)

### **EXPLICIT PRIORITY RANKING:**

**Power Law #1: SLEEP** 
- "You are a professional sleeper"
- "It's the foundation of every other part of your life"
- "If you get your sleep right, everything else becomes easier"

**Power Law #2: EXERCISE**
- "When you sleep well, you feel well. When you feel well, you move well."
- 30 minutes/day minimum
- Move every 20-30 minutes throughout day

**Power Law #3: DIET**
- "That's why diet is Power Law #3, not #1"
- "When you're well-rested and moving, you naturally want to eat better"
- "If you're sleep-deprived and sedentary, your cravings take over"

### **KEY INSIGHT:**
Bryan explicitly states diet is #3 (not #1 or #2) because:
1. Sleep enables exercise
2. Sleep + Exercise enable better diet choices
3. Without sleep, willpower fails

This is a **cascading priority system**, not equal weighting.

5. **Avoid stimulants** - No caffeine 6+ hours before bed

### **Sleep Identity:**
