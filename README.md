## Overview

Daman-Hayat AI is an integrated platform combining multi-modal early disease detection with continuous monitoring and sustained behavior change to close the healthspan-lifespan gap for UAE nationals covered by Thiqa insurance.

**Investment Ask:** $15 Million USD  
**Target Market:** 1M+ Thiqa Members  
**5-Year ROI:** 5,005%

---

## The Problem

UAE nationals live an average of **83.2 years** but remain healthy for only **67.0 years**—creating a devastating **16.2-year gap** where citizens are alive but sick. This ranks UAE **#7 globally** among countries with the most years lived in poor health.

**Key Statistics:**
- **35,556 Thiqa members** currently living in the gap (ages 67-83)
- **Annual economic burden:** $1.63 billion
- **CVD is #1 killer:** 40% of all UAE deaths
- **Gap is widening:** Projected to reach 20-22 years by 2040

## The Solution

**Multi-Modal Early Detection (6 Data Sources):**
1. Blood biomarkers - Traditional labs + AI cancer detection
2. Genome analysis - UAE Genome Database access
3. Medical imaging - CT, MRI, ultrasound
4. AI retinal screening - Google Health AI partnership
5. Wearable devices - Continuous cardiac monitoring
6. DEXA scan - Visceral fat and bone density

**Behavior Change Platform:**
- Personalized nutrition tracking
- AI-powered health coaching
- Gamification and cultural adaptation
- Wearable integration for real-time feedback

## Currency Conversions

All financial figures in this repository are presented in **USD** using the conversion rate of **1 AED = 0.272 USD** (1 USD = 3.67 AED).

**Key Conversions:**
- Retinal screening: ~$27 per scan (originally AED 100)
- DEXA scan: $100-200 per scan (originally AED 367-734)
- Traditional imaging: $272-1,360 (originally AED 1,000-5,000)
- Thiqa annual budget: $3.0B (verified from AED 11B)

---

## Pending Implementation

Based on the handover document, the following updates are pending:

### 1. Add AI Cancer Detection (7th Data Source)
- Update multi-modal detection to include AI-powered cancer screening
- 50+ cancer types with 10-year advance warning
- Focus on UAE common cancers: breast, colorectal, thyroid, lung

### 2. Emphasize CVD as #1 Killer
- Add statistics: "40% of all UAE deaths are from CVD"
- Highlight: "UAE CVD death rates are twice the global average"
- Messaging: "Heart disease striking younger—average age decreasing"

### 3. Purple Border Marking
- Mark all updated slides with purple borders for easy identification
- Removable after final approval
