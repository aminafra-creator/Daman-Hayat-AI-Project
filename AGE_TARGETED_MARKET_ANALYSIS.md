# Age-Targeted Addressable Market Analysis

**Date:** November 7, 2025  
**Purpose:** Calculate realistic addressable market within 790K Thiqa members  
**Focus:** People 50+, chronic disease patients, high healthcare utilizers

---

## 🎯 TARGET POPULATION DEFINITION

### **Who We're Targeting:**
1. **Age 60+ (in healthspan gap):** Already experiencing chronic disease burden
2. **Age 50-59 (entering gap):** Prevention window before major health decline

## 🎯 THIQA TARGET MARKET CALCULATION

### **Total Thiqa Members:** 790,000 UAE nationals

### **Age-Based Segmentation:**

| Segment | % of Thiqa | Members | Priority | Rationale |
|---------|------------|---------|----------|-----------|
| **60+ years** | 10% | **79,000** | 🔴 **HIGH** | Already in healthspan gap, highest cost |
| **50-59 years** | 12% | **94,800** | 🟡 **MEDIUM** | Entering gap, prevention window |
| **40-49 years (chronic)** | 5% | **39,500** | 🟢 **LOW** | High-risk subset only |
| **TOTAL TARGET** | **27%** | **213,300** | | Realistic addressable market |

### **Calculation Details:**

```
60+ years: 790,000 × 10% = 79,000 members
50-59 years: 790,000 × 12% = 94,800 members
40-49 years (chronic): 790,000 × 5% = 39,500 members

TOTAL TARGET MARKET: 79,000 + 94,800 + 39,500 = 213,300 members
```

## 💰 REVISED MARKET SIZING

### **Addressable Market (Age-Targeted):**

**Total Thiqa Members:** 790,000  
**Target Population (50+, chronic):** 213,300 (27% of Thiqa)

**TAM Calculation:**
```
Target members: 213,300
Healthspan value: $70,000 per member
TAM: 213,300 × $70,000 = $14,931,000,000 = $14.9B ≈ $15B
```

**Comparison to Original:**
- Original TAM (all 790K): $55.3B
- Age-targeted TAM (213K): $15B
- **Reduction:** 73% (more realistic, focused on high-value segment)

## 📈 REVISED PENETRATION SCENARIOS

### **Realistic Penetration Rates (of 213,300 target population):**

| Scenario | Penetration | Members | ARR | Valuation (10x) | Seed Returns |
|----------|-------------|---------|-----|-----------------|--------------|
| **Pilot (Month 18)** | 0.2% | 500 | $0.9M | N/A | N/A |
| **Series A (Year 2)** | 4.7% | 10,000 | $18M | $150M | 3x |
| **Year 3 (Conservative)** | 14% | 30,000 | $54M | $540M | 10.8x |
| **Year 4 (Moderate)** | 28% | 60,000 | $108M | $1.08B | 21.6x |
| **Year 5 (Aggressive)** | 47% | 100,000 | $180M | $1.8B | 36x |
| **Mature (50% penetration)** | 50% | 106,650 | $192M | $1.92B | 38.4x |

### **Calculation Details:**

```
Series A (10,000 members):
10,000 / 213,300 = 4.7% penetration
10,000 × $1,800/year = $18M ARR

Year 3 (30,000 members):
30,000 / 213,300 = 14% penetration
30,000 × $1,800/year = $54M ARR

Year 5 (100,000 members):
100,000 / 213,300 = 47% penetration
100,000 × $1,800/year = $180M ARR
$180M × 10x = $1.8B valuation
$1.8B / $50M seed post-money = 36x returns
```

## 💡 WHY AGE-TARGETING IS SMARTER

### **Benefits of Focusing on 50+ Population:**

**1. Higher ROI:**
- 50+ population costs 3-5x more per capita than younger members
- Greater potential for cost savings (preventable disease burden)
- Faster payback period for Daman/Thiqa

**2. Easier to Prove Value:**
- Measurable health improvements in 6-12 months
- Clear cost reduction (fewer hospitalizations, ER visits)
- Higher engagement (motivated by health concerns)

**3. More Realistic Penetration:**
- 50% of 213K (106,650 members) is achievable
- 50% of 790K (395,000 members) is unrealistic in 5 years

**4. Better Investor Story:**
- "We're targeting the highest-cost, highest-value segment"
- "Proven value with 50+, then expand to younger prevention"
- "Clear path to profitability with focused approach"

## 📊 COST SAVINGS ANALYSIS

### **Why 50+ Population Matters to Daman/Thiqa:**

**Healthcare Cost Distribution:**
- **50+ population (27% of members)** → **60-70% of healthcare costs**
- **Under 50 (73% of members)** → **30-40% of healthcare costs**

**Calculation:**
```
Total Thiqa spend: AED 20-30B annually
Assume 65% goes to 50+ population: AED 13-19.5B

Target population: 213,300 members (50+)
Per-capita spend: AED 13B / 213K = AED 61,000/year ($16,600)
                or AED 19.5B / 213K = AED 91,500/year ($24,900)

This is 2-3x higher than all-age average (AED 25-38K)
```

**Preventable Burden (50+ population):**
```
CVD: 80% preventable
Diabetes: 90% preventable
Cancer: 40-50% preventable

Weighted average: ~70% preventable for 50+ population

Preventable spend: AED 13-19.5B × 70% = AED 9.1-13.7B ($2.5-3.7B/year)
```

**Value Proposition to Daman:**
> "If Hayat AI can reduce preventable disease burden by just 20% in the 50+ population, that's AED 1.8-2.7 billion ($490-735M) in annual savings for Thiqa."
