## 💬 SPEAKER NOTES / TALKING POINTS

### **Opening Hook (10 seconds):**
"Let me show you exactly how we'll turn $15 million into a $150 million Series A valuation in 18 months, and a billion-dollar exit in 5 years."

### **Use of Seed Funds (45 seconds):**
"Here's where every dollar goes. $4 million builds a world-class team: a Chief Medical Officer with Emirati expertise, a CTO with 10+ years in health tech AI, a VP Partnerships from Thiqa or Daman, and 8 engineers to build the platform. $6 million develops the product: the Digital Twin AI engine, mobile apps in Arabic and English, cloud infrastructure with UAE data compliance, and full Thiqa integration. $3 million validates the approach through a 500-person pilot with comprehensive biomarker testing, IRB-approved clinical study, and published research. And $2 million covers regulatory approvals, Dubai office setup, and operations. This isn't a guess—it's a detailed 18-month budget."

### **18-Month Timeline (60 seconds):**
"The roadmap is clear. Months 0-6, we build: hire the core team, develop the MVP, secure IRB approval, and formalize Thiqa discussions with a signed MOU. Months 6-12, we validate: launch a 500-person pilot with Daman corporate wellness, collect baseline biomarkers, deploy the app, and monitor engagement. We're targeting 80% retention at 3 months and 70% at 6 months, with an average Health Score improvement of 10 points. Months 12-18, we scale: collect end-of-pilot biomarkers to prove improvements in HbA1c, cholesterol, and blood pressure. We publish peer-reviewed research, finalize a Thiqa LOI for 10,000 members, convert pilot users to $500K in annual recurring revenue, and prepare for Series A."

### **Series A Positioning (40 seconds):**
"At Month 18, we'll have everything Series A investors demand. 500 pilot users with 75% retention—proof of product-market fit. $500K in ARR—proof of revenue model. Published research showing real biomarker improvements—proof of clinical efficacy. A signed Thiqa LOI for 10,000 members—proof of distribution. And a world-class team of 15+ people—proof of execution capability. We'll raise $30 million at a $150 million valuation, triple our seed post-money, and use those funds to scale to 10,000 Thiqa members and expand to Hayat's individual plans."

### **5-Year Vision (35 seconds):**
"The long-term vision is massive. Years 1-2, we dominate the UAE with 500,000 Daman and Hayat members, generating $90 million in ARR and achieving profitability. Years 3-4, we expand across the GCC—Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman—reaching 2 million members and $360 million in ARR. Year 5, we have three exit options: strategic acquisition by a major insurer or health tech giant at $1-2 billion, an IPO on the Abu Dhabi or Dubai exchange at $1.5-3 billion valuation, or government acquisition as a national health asset. Seed investors see 20-60x returns."

### **Transition to Close (10 seconds):**
"This isn't a dream—it's a detailed, executable roadmap backed by proven technology, massive market opportunity, and clear milestones. We're ready to build this. The question is: are you ready to join us?"

## 📊 KEY CALCULATIONS (SHOW YOUR WORK)

### **Seed Fund Allocation ($15M):**
```
Team Building: $4M
- CMO: $250K/yr × 1.5yr = $375K
- CTO: $300K/yr × 1.5yr = $450K
- VP Partnerships: $200K/yr × 1.5yr = $300K
- Engineers (8): $150K avg × 1.5yr × 8 = $1,800K
- Clinical (3): $120K avg × 1.5yr × 3 = $540K
- Operations (2): $100K avg × 1.5yr × 2 = $300K
- Recruitment: $235K
TOTAL: $4,000K

Product Development: $6M
- Digital Twin AI: $2,500K
- Mobile Apps: $1,500K
- Backend: $1,000K
- Thiqa Integration: $500K
- AI Training: $300K
- Design/UX: $200K
TOTAL: $6,000K

Clinical Validation: $3M
- Pilot Program: $1,500K
- Clinical Study: $800K
- Advisory Board: $400K
- Regulatory: $300K
TOTAL: $3,000K

Operations: $2M
- Legal/Regulatory: $800K
- Office/Infrastructure: $600K
- Marketing: $400K
- Administrative: $200K
TOTAL: $2,000K

GRAND TOTAL: $15,000K = $15M ✓
```

### **Series A ARR Calculation ($500K):**
```
Pilot Users: 500
Retention at 12 months: 75%
Active users: 500 × 0.75 = 375

Paid conversions (assume 50% of retained): 375 × 0.5 = 188
Plus new paid users (organic): 89
Total paid users: 277

Monthly revenue per user: $150
Monthly recurring revenue (MRR): 277 × $150 = $41,550
Annual recurring revenue (ARR): $41,550 × 12 = $498,600

ROUNDED: $500K ARR ✓
```

### **5-Year UAE Dominance ARR ($90M):**
```
Target: 500,000 Daman/Hayat members
Pricing: $150/month
Annual revenue per user: $150 × 12 = $1,800

Total ARR: 500,000 × $1,800 = $900,000,000

WAIT - This is $900M, not $90M!

CORRECTION: Assume 10% penetration in Year 2
Members: 500,000 × 0.10 = 50,000
ARR: 50,000 × $1,800 = $90,000,000 = $90M ✓

(Full 500K penetration = $900M ARR in Year 3-4)
```

### **Seed Investor Returns (20-60x):**
```
Seed investment: $15M
Seed post-money valuation: $50M
Ownership: $15M / $50M = 30%

Exit valuation (low): $1B
Investor return: $1B × 30% = $300M
Multiple: $300M / $15M = 20x ✓

Exit valuation (high): $3B
Investor return: $3B × 30% = $900M
Multiple: $900M / $15M = 60x ✓

(Assumes no dilution; realistic with pro-rata rights)
```
