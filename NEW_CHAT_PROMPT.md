## 🚨 CRITICAL CONTEXT

**Who We Are:**
- **Hayat AI** = Us (Digital Twin healthspan platform)
- We are **pitching TO Daman** (who manages Thiqa)
- **Thiqa** = Abu Dhabi Government's 100% coverage program for UAE nationals

**Target Market:**
- **213,300 Thiqa members** (age 50+, chronic disease)
- **27% of Thiqa members** = **60-70% of healthcare costs**
- **NOT targeting:** All 790K Thiqa (too broad), expats, or workers

**Key Decisions:**
- Seed stage (not Series A) - honest positioning, no team/product yet
- $1,800/year pricing (not $1,200) - better value proposition
- 15% annual churn (factored into all projections) - realistic
- 18% penetration (not 47%) - achievable vs Twin Health's 30%+
- HTML format (not PPTX) - no formatting issues
